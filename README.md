## Dont Forget to input the path for the text file

## Features
- Processes text input
- Counts occurrences of each word
- Displays word frequency results
- Uses efficient data structures for counting

## How It Works
1. Reads input text
2. Splits text into words
3. Normalizes words (e.g., case handling)
4. Uses a map to track frequency counts
5. Outputs each word with its count

## Technologies Used
- Java
- HashMap / Collections Framework
- String Processing
